[*All the Sinners Bleed* by S. A. Crosby](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61884832-all-the-sinners-bleed)

This started promisingly. After an appropriately foreboding prologue steeped in Southern Gothic flavour, the stakes are set with reasonable swiftness. About a quarter of the way in, though, the book turned progressively sour for me. Make no mistake&mdash;Crosby can write a poetic turn of phrase, but he overdoes it to the point of parody. Every other sentence is a simile, often forced and awkward. The edgelord-y violence, unsubtle themes, cartoonish characterisation, topped off by a mopey protagonist who can't stop feeling sorry for himself and the rest of the human race, all made for a disappointing read. [*Small Mercies*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61812308-small-mercies) this is not.
