[House of Lilies: The Dynasty That Made Medieval France](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198493964-house-of-lilies) by  Justine Firnhaber-Baker

Superb guided tour of a consanguineous maze of Philips, Louises and Joans. 

When learning about the Norman Conquest, the Anarchy and the early Plantagenet kings, I'd encountered the Capetians mostly from the perspective of their English contemporaries. This concise volume filled in the gaps wonderfully, sketching an eminently readable and illuminating portrait of the Capetian dynasty, beginning from Hugh Capet and ending with Philip the Fair and his sons. I found this a delightful page-turner, chock full of continental politics, crusading kings and shifting borders. Most importantly, it's well researched, with footnotes and sources aplenty, not to mention the author's academic bona fides.
