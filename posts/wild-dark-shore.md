[Wild Dark Shore by Charlotte McConaghy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211004089-wild-dark-shore)

Climate fiction with a heavy dash of gothic salt (eh?). Surreal, mysterious, alluring, eerie, isolating - I was fully immersed in the setting. The beginning also gave me real [Annihilation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530-annihilation) vibes. The botany factoids that peppered the story were charming. Sadly, there were a few things that soured my experience. The reveal was a letdown. The character dynamics veered into the saccharine. The antagonist's motivations were both eye-rolling and handwavy. Overall a decent read despite these flaws.
