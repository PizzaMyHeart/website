[Leviathan Wakes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8855321-leviathan-wakes) by James S.A. Corey

Good pulpy scifi fun. I'd avoided this for the longest time, as I wasn't sure if the 9-book investment was worth it after finishing the TV adaptation (which I thoroughly enjoyed). I think watching the show first helped me get into this book&mdash;the excellent production design brought the story to life in my mind's eye while reading, and I clearly pictured Wes Chatham and Thomas Jane during all the Amos and Miller bits. 

Ultimately though, this *is* popcorn entertainment, and the dialogue leaves much to be desired, especially among Holden and his crew. But the prose is adequate, and the pacing is great, with each chapter picking right up from the last one. I'd say Miller and the compelling setting made it worth the read, and I look forward to continuing the rest of the (completed!) series. The last three books should be interesting since they aren't covered by the TV show.
