[Say Nothing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40163119-say-nothing) by Patrick Radden Keefe

This is an all-timer. The Troubles is messy from start to finish, full of internecine conflicts with far reaching consequences in the present day. This book manages to capture a large slice of it with incredible clarity and nuance. You can feel the weight not just of this awful history, but also of the staggering amount of effort that went into producing this account of it.
