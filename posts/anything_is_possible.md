[Anything Is Possible by Elizabeth Strout](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32080126-anything-is-possible)

It was fun to see Amgash fleshed out, and I think Strout nails the theme of "life is messy". But I enjoyed [My Name Is Lucy Barton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25893709-my-name-is-lucy-barton) quite a bit more, with its tighter writing. I know it's apples and oranges, but there you are.
