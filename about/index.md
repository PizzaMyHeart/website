## About me

I'm a medical student in the UK with too many hobbies, and exam stress typically results in a Cambrian explosion of new obsessions. Including this website. 

You can find me on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@PizzaMyHeart).

## About this website

A product of my love for computers and tinkering, as well as a resolution to write more. I outline my expectations in this [post](../posts/first-post).

No cookies, no tracking, no analytics &mdash; ethical considerations aside, I write to process and collect my fragmented thoughts, and though I'd like to think someone out there might enjoy my writing, clicks and views are not my goal. I briefly thought about setting up some rudimentary analytics just to satisfy my curiosity, but I'm glad I decided against it. This is an entirely personal project, not a business venture or even a side hustle, where it makes sense to try to reach as many eyeballs as possible. 

That said, posting my writing online often feels like shouting into the void. I've made this website a part of the [Hotline Webring](https://hotlinewebring.club/). Maybe I do want to reach a few eyeballs. Just one pair is good enough for me. Doesn't matter whose eyeballs they are (unless they're yours, in which case I totally appreciate you stopping by. Great eyeballs by the way).

Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and generated by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) using the [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) template, with some light CSS modification. I hope to revamp the website's appearance when I have the time, but I suspect even then it would be an ongoing endeavour. [Yak shaving](https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html) is an integral part of The Experience<sup>TM</sup>.
